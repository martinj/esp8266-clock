This is based on [Mini 7 Segment Smart Clock](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3117494) that required node red and mqtt.

My version uses [blynk](https://www.blynk.cc/) as a control.

I also made some small adjustments to to original 3d files to add a switch and micro usb break out board wich can be found here
